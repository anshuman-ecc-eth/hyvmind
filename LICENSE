SECTION 2 - SCOPE

a. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public 
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the 
Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

   1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; 
      and

   2. produce, reproduce, and Share an Adaptation, provided that You 
      include a copy of, or Uniform Resource Identifier for, this 
      Public License with every Adaptation You make.

b. Adapter's License. If You Share an Adaptation You make, or if You 
create an Adaptation subject to Adapter's License, You may apply 
Adapter's License instead of this Public License to that Adaptation, 
provided that You include a copy of, or Uniform Resource Identifier 
for, Adapter's License with every Adaptation You make, and You may not 
offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, 
or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Adaptation if 
doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights in the Adaptation.

c. Downstream Recipients. Every time You Share or Distribute an 
Adaptation, the Adaptation's licensor offers to the recipient a 
license to the Licensed Material on the same terms and conditions as 
the license granted to You under this Public License.

d. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any 
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective 
Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts 
exercise of the Licensed Rights from any recipient or downstream 
recipient.

e. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may 
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that 
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, 
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others 
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

======================================================================

SECTION 3 - LICENSE CONDITIONS

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the 
following conditions.

a. Attribution.

   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), 
      You must:

      (A) retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with 
          the Licensed Material:

         (i) identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed 
             Material and any others designated to receive attribution, 
             in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor 
             (including by pseudonym if designated);

         (ii) a copyright notice;

         (iii) a notice that refers to this Public License;

         (iv) a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

         (v) a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent 
             reasonably practicable;

      (B) indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an 
          indication of any previous modifications; and

      (C) indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public 
          License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, 
          this Public License.

   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any 
      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in 
      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be 
      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or 
      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the 
      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent 
      reasonably practicable.

b. ShareAlike. In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You 
Share an Adaptation You make, the following conditions also apply.

   1. The Adapter's License You apply to Your Adaptation must be this 
      Public License or a BY-SA Compatible License.

   2. You must include a copy of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the 
      Adapter's License You apply to Your Adaptation.

   3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or 
      conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, 
      the Adaptation if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed 
      Rights from any recipient or downstream recipient.

======================================================================

SECTION 4 - SUI GENERIS DATABASE RIGHTS

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that 
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right 
to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion 
of the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database 
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, 
then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but 
not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share 
all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not 
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed 
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

======================================================================

SECTION 7 - TERM AND TERMINATION

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and 
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this 
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate 
automatically.

Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop 
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
